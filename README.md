# Capstone-Project
This is the capstone project for the data science nano degree from Udacity
This project includes working on simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app, 
I have cleaned and trained the model to predict the behavior of a person receiving an offer with f1 score of 82%

The libraries used:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. math
4. json
5. tqdm
6. matplotlib
6. sklearn
7. datetime
8. sklearn

The files included in this repository are:
1. Faris_Majdali_Capstone_notebook.ipynb: a jupyter notebook which contains the documented code of this project
2. offers_df.pkl: a pickle file that contains the cleaned data of offers and the model was trained on this data, it is one of the outputs of the jupyter notebook above
3. transactions_df.pkl: a pickle file that contains the cleaned transactional data, it is one of the outputs of the jupyter notebook above
4. profile.json: containing offer IDs and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.), project source data
5. portfolio.json: demographic data for each customer, project source data
6. transcript.json: couldn't uploaded the file as it exceeds 25 MB you can find it in the link(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L48ax8X9kI1vXUY7cCYyQme-E0iO011J/view?usp=drive_link), it contains records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed, project source data

I want to thank all Udacity Data Science instructors for all the useful information and for making what seems impossible to be possible.
